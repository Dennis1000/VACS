  Additions V1.20:

    V1.20 is modified for Turbo Pascal V5.0, most of the changes are
    preparations for the relocatable assembler version, see SHORTREF.DOC
    for functional overvieuw.

                     --  Wil Taphoorn 1989 --

  - SECTION operand reversal (see sectiontypes below)

  - Optional sectiontypes: ABSOLUTE, PAGE and INPAGE
        SECTION  xxxx,ABSOLUTE  ;non-relocatable section
        SECTION  xxxx           ;byte-relocatable section
        SECTION  xxxx,PAGE      ;located on a page start: xx00H
        SECTION  xxxx,INPAGE    ;byte-relocatable, totally inside a 100H page

  - RESUME pseudo opcode for re-definition of SECTION
        SECTION  MAIN,ABSOLUTE  ;non-relocatable section
        ORG      0
        ..
        SECTION  DATA,ABSOLUTE  ;switch to other section
        ORG      8000H
        ..
        RESUME   MAIN           ;continue MAIN section

  - NAME pseudo opcode to name the module.
        NAME	PART_ONE	;names the module "PART_ONE"

  - GLOBAL pseudo opcode: for global definition of identifiers.
      (symboltable.Def has an additional defined state of 'Global')
        GLOBAL  name, name ..   ;will initialize each 'names' to 0000

  - BASE pseudo operator: to check the section base of a symbol.
        IF  BASE  name    ;this is true (-1) if 'name' is initialized in the
                          ;current section (could be forward too).

  - Optional '/' (slash) unary operator for operands in ORG statements:
    if the slash is used, then the location counter is set to the next address
    that is a multiple of the value after the '/'. If the location counter is
    already on such an address, nothing is changed.
    Assume the location counter on 0355H
    then
        ORG  /100H        ;will set the location counter to 0400H
    but another
        ORG  /100H        ;will leave the location counter at 0400H

  - Commandline Option-indicator choise '-' or '/'

  - Additional commandline options:
        -h, -? or ?  = help screen
        -b <num>     = set tabs [4..20] (Default 8)
        -p           = suppress the pre-processor
        -q           = quiet operation

  - Program terminate if unrecognized options in interactive mode

  - Distinction between errors and warnings (non-severe errors)

  - MS_DOS errorlevels defined
        0 = No Errors
        1 = Console Abort
        2 = Assembly Warnings detected
        3 = Assembly Errors detected
        4 = I/O problems
        5 = Internal Error

  - Give the assemblers the name VACS (Verschueren Assembler Construction Set)

  - Some changes to the list file:
    * Date- and Time stamp appended
    * Module name appended
    * Module checksum appended 
    * Title string inserted in first line (now limited to 40 characters)
    * Page number moved to the right
    * Listfile concluded with 2 lines:
      1)       n Source Lines      n Assembled Lines        n Bytes Available

      2)         >>>>  No Assembly Errors Detected  <<<<
         or:
              n Errors Found
         or:
              1 Error Found

  - STRING pseudo opcode to declare identifier(s) as a stringvariabele
             STRING     str1, str2, ..

  - SET pseudo opcode modified for string assignments

  - PRPROCES and NOPROCES turns pre-processor on and off at will

  - Pre-processor for text replacements:
    Procedure NextLine will pre-process incoming data for text-replacements
    These are parameters enclosed in backquote characters ` (60H)
    current implementations are:
     `%` is replaced by the current section name (uppercase)
     `<strident>` is replaced by the contents of <strident>
     `@`, `#`, `<ident>` and `<numexpr>` are reserved for macro expansion:
    Example:
             STRING    segname    ;declare SEGNAME to be a string variabele
             SECTION   rom
             ..
    segname  SET      "`%`"       ;SEGNAME is assigned ROM
             SECTION  ram         ;start new section
             ..
             RESUME   `segname`   ;resume ROM
             ..
    Character ^ (5EH) is used to flag the next character as a literal
    i.e. "This backquote doesn^`t generate an error"


  - The planning for text replacement at macro expansion time is:
     `#`  is replaced by the number of call parameters (like argc in C)
     `n`  where n = 1, 2, 3..
          is replaced by call parameter[n] (like argv[n] in C)
     `@`  is replaced by a 4-char ascii string, representing the current
          macro invokation count
          (this is to create labels inside macros)
          i.e. LAB`@` is a unique 7-char label, for each macro expansion

  Additions V1.21:

  - BACKWARD and FORWARD pseudo instructions added.
  - WARNING pseudo instruction added.
  - 'R' option adds line number info on error/warning lines

  Additions V1.22:

  - SetUserIdent() added (ASMINP.PAS), changes the current line label value.
  - /R option inserts line number info on error/warning lines in list file.
  - /D option display error lines on stdout in Microsoft (tm) format, for
       use with intelligent editors.

  Changes V1.23a:
  - the Till32X construct is changed.
  - boolean array 'UserFlag[0..15]' and integer array 'UserVar[0..15]'
    appended for to forfill the need of static memory inside ASMINC.PAS.

  Changes V1.23b:
  - introduction of local labels: any label that has the '>' suffix can be
    re-defined for backward reference.

  Changes V1.23c:
  - bug in memory allocation fixed.

  Changes V1.23d:
  - bug in ORG / construct fixed.
  - AM552: additions for 80552 assembler:
    * pseudo register set RB0..RB3
    * macro SEL
    * directive USING changed to ASSUME

  Changes V1.23e:
  - additon of read-only variable $MSUM: returns the current ModuleChecksum,
    i.e. the modulo 65536 sum of all preceeding written object bytes.

  Changes V1.23f:
  - addition of numeric to ASCII format in DB lists, like in ToCon lists:
      :<num>  generates 4-digit ASCII-hex string
      *<num>  generates 1 to 5 digits ASCII numeric string

  Changes V1.23g:
  - addition of optional filler value in DS instructions
     DS    5, 3       ;fill 5 consecutive locations with value 3
     DS    10, 'A'    ;fill 10 consequtive locations with character 'A'

  Changes V1.23h:
  - addition of boolean field RefTo in symboltable records to keep track
    wheter or not labels are referred to. identifier listing shows "not used"
    for labels that are not reffered to.

  Changes 1.24:
  - option 'V' reports total number of unused labels on screen and in list file
  - labels on opcode-less lines now MUST have either colon suffix ":" or
    local-label suffix ">" to improve invalid opcode recognition
  - first release of VACS 32-bit version, all operands and internal 
    calculation is changed from 16-bit to 32-bit.
  - new pseudos:
     DD          define double
     LW          returns lower word of operand
     HW          returns higer word of operand
     <<          shift left operator (new for SHL)
     >>          shift right operator (new for SHR)
     =           numeric to 8-digit hex conversion operator (DB, TOCON etc)
     ABS         returns absolute value of operand
